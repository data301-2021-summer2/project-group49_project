# Group 49 - Can You Feel the Beat?

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150/200 words.
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Clinical data analysis is an important asset in predicting possible cardiovascular diseases. The large collection of raw healthcare data is manipulated into useful information through data mining; the process of analyzing large batches of information to recognize trends and patterns which can be used by physicians to make informed predictions and necessary medical interventions. Overall, about 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, this accounts for one in every four deaths. As the field of medicine evolves, professionals are expected to become more efficient and experience increased pressures to become more productive in both patient care and research. In recent decades, there have been many technological advancements that are better at predicting cardiovascular disease, such as the heart monitoring data system in the Apple Watch. 
Moreover, I'd like to set forth the following research questions for my project:
1. Are women more likely to get a heart attack than men?
2. Do higher cholesterol levels increase the chance of a person having a heart attack?
3. What variable relationships result in a heart attack?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words.

The dataset was published by the University of California, Irvine, from their Machine Learning repository. The dataset focuses on several risk factors of cardiovascular disease in individuals, such as cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and the maximum heart rate achieved, to name a few. Containing information from 303 patients, their sex and varying ages. By examining various trends and patterns associated with this dataset, it is possible to analyze the relationship between these -health factors and the probability of a heart attack occurring in a patient. There are several risk factors that can contribute to the heightened potential of heart disease. The dataset allows us to map the relationships to certain lifestyle choices such as physical inactiveness, alcohol abuse and fast food consumption. Moreover, major risk factors such as high cholesterol and diabetes correlated with cardiovascular illness can be observed through the analysis of the datasets. Due to the interconnected nature of datasets, corporations can access high volumes of information which in turn can allow medical professionals to accurately pinpoint these factors and take preventative measures. However, there are a few limitations that accompany this dataset. The sample size for example is relatively small, and would possibly compromise the conclusions drawn from this study as it is not completely representative of the entire population of people who suffer from cardiac diseases.
